Background and Justification: Like many college campuses, Alabama A&M University faces challenges with transportation accessibility. Many students lack access to personal vehicles, while others face high commuting costs, limited parking options, or irregular public transportation schedules. The problem is that students need a safe, affordable, and reliable way to get around both on and off campus. Traditional rideshare services like Uber and Lyft can be expensive, and campus shuttles do not always meet every student’s schedule. Maroon Moves is designed to solve this issue by creating a student-centered rideshare platform exclusively for Alabama A&M.We plan to solve these problems by:
Developing a mobile app and web platform that allows students to request or offer rides.
 Using students’ ID verification to ensure security and limit use to the AAMU community.
 Adding features like ride scheduling, cost-sharing, and route optimization. 
Project Objectives: 
Improve Campus Transportation

Promote Affordability 
Encourage Sustainability

Leverage new-age technology
